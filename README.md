# mushroom-classification
Classification of mushrooms' edibility by their physical characteristics
### Project Scenario

You're thinking of going on a hike through the forest.

You enjoy mushrooms a lot, and anticipate them appearing as you traverse the woods. The problem with mushrooms is that while many are edible, there are those among them that are highly poisonous.

Fortunately, you remember that there's a field guide containing mushroom information; you decide to train a model to tell you whether the mushrooms you encounter are poisonous.

### What we'll be doing:
In this project, we will do the following:

1. Download mushroom field guide data and clean the data up (Part I)
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (Part II)
3. Apply machine learning techniques to train a model to predict mushroom edibility (Part III and IV)

### Dataset
We'll be getting our data from the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. 

More specifically, the data is submitted by the Audobon Society Field Guide, a nature reference. 

Download the data <a href = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/'>here</a>. We will need only two files:
1. agarious-lepiota.data
2. agarious-lepiota.names
